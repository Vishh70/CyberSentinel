        <h2>What is Phishing?</h2>
        <p>Phishing is a form of cybercrime where attackers attempt to trick individuals into divulging personal, sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or social security numbers. They often do this through email, messages, or fraudulent websites.</p>

        <h2>Common Phishing Techniques</h2>
        <p>Phishing attackers often use a variety of techniques to deceive their victims:</p>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Website Phishing:</strong> Fake websites that look like trusted ones, where attackers try to steal your login credentials or payment information.</li>
            <li><strong>Vishing (Voice Phishing):</strong> Phishing attempts made over the phone where attackers impersonate a legitimate institution to extract information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Protect Yourself from Phishing</h2>
